# Lord of the Rings API React Native Code Test
## Time: 
~45 Minutes dev time, 15 minutes wrap up, questions and conversation

## Language: 
Javascript/React Native

## Project Summary: 
Today, we will build a simple React Native application that runs in a simulator, saves some simple data about the user in local state using a state management tool of your choice and connects to a simple API.

Expect to verbally communicate your thought processes and test code when appropriate and possible. You are free to use available libraries for interfacing with the API, pull code from your previous projects, Google anything you need to or refer to StackOverflow or any other references you might need, including React Native docs.

The goal of this project is to understand your thought processes and collaborative, communication and working style. Be sure to think through any potential edge cases or test scenarios that might be important.

You are not expected to finish all of the requirements of the project — when we’re reaching the end of the time, we’ll recap and discuss our progress so far and you may be asked several questions about decisions you made in the test.
